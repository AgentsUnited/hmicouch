## The Conversational Intent Planner module

## Build
To build this module you need Ant and the HMI Build Tool, available in [this repository](https://github.com/ArticulatedSocialAgentsPlatform/hmibuild/tree/master). It must be placed in the parent folder, next to the *hmicouch* folder. Then run the commands `ant clean`, `ant resolve` and `ant compile`. Take a look at how it was done in the [demontrator repository](https://github.com/AgentsUnited/demonstrator) readme instructions.
